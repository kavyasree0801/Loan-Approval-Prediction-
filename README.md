# Loan Approval Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model to assess the credit risk associated with loan applicants and determine whether to approve or reject their loan requests. The model analyzes various factors such as applicant demographics, income, credit history, employment status, and loan characteristics. By learning from historical data, the model identifies patterns and relationships to inform future lending decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is named `loan_approval_dataset`. It contains financial records and related information utilized to assess the eligibility of individuals or organizations for loans from a lending institution.

## File Descriptions

### Project Files

- **Project_FA.ipynb**: This is the main project code file. It contains the entire workflow for the loan approval prediction, including:
  - Data loading and preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature engineering
  - Model building (KNN and Logistic Regression before and after feature engineering)
  - Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation
  - Resampling techniques for data balancing
  - Visualization of results

### Other Files

- **README.md**: This readme file provides an overview of the project, dataset, file descriptions, and instructions on how to run the code.
- **loan_approval_dataset.csv**: The dataset file containing the loan approval data.

## Instructions


1. **Run the Project**:
   Open the `Project_FA.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment and run the cells sequentially to execute the entire workflow. Make sure the dataset file `loan_approval_dataset.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook or update the path accordingly.

2. **Explore the Results**:
   The results, including model performance metrics and visualizations, will be generated within the notebook. Compare the performance of models before and after feature engineering and resampling techniques.

## Future Scope

- Integration of external data sources to enhance predictive accuracy.
- Development of a real-time deployment pipeline.
- Creation of a user-friendly interface for customers to track loan status and receive personalized suggestions for improving eligibility.
